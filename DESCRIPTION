Description: An implementation of the 'k-means--' algorithm proposed
    by Chawla and Gionis, 2013 in their paper,
    "k-means-- : A unified approach to clustering and outlier detection.
    SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM13)",
    <doi:10.1137/1.9781611972832.21>
    and using 'ordering' described by Howe, 2013 in the thesis,
    Clustering and anomaly detection in tropical cyclones".
    Useful for creating (potentially) tighter clusters than
    standard k-means and simultaneously finding outliers inexpensively
    in multidimensional space.
